# TriviaGame
Take 2, I stole better code, much cleaner and easyer to work with and understand, I replaced all the questions, answers and images. I do think I understood most of what the code is doing but the CSS and sizing of the header is still lost on me. but hey its a fun game, I did not link this to my bio page becouse it still looks like poo. Ill take a B please. thanks!


Pseudo Code,

With a timer of 120 seconeds the player must choose one of 4 options from 8 qestions, each question must show one question at a time. Once the timer runns out the screen must show the final score, Corect answers, wrong answers, and un answerd quesstions.

No answer can be answered with 2 answers and only one button can be pressed.

I really dont have any idea where to start, its like I cant keep all the part we have learned togehter and while I know I should make the code work before I work on the html/CSS I just dont know how to even start...

SO I stole someones code, and it kinda worked. still messing with it, its funny, I can read the code and uns=derstand it, but creating this from scratch is just not how my brain is set to work...
